# Donations

Here is the list of non-profit organizations that I think have the best impact on the world in terms of my altruistic values

I created this list for 2 reasons

- it might be interesting to people with similar values  
  they can find new interesting organizations or discuss the choices I made with me, potentially improving my future choices
- people that want to show they appreciate me with gifts can instead give to any of those organizations and tell me about their donation  
  I am very minimalist and therefore strongly prefer receiving money or people making a donation to one of those organizations and telling me, than receiving other kinds of gifts that I will probably not use and have to waste time getting rid of

### My altruistic values

This is a non-exhaustive list of my altruistic values, most of which are shared with organizations listed on this page  
the value listed probably includes a mix of intrinsic and instrumental values, there might be overlap as well

- **Reducing suffering**  
  I want to reduce (and if possible eliminate) suffering for all beings that can suffer, that includes reducing suffering for humans and non-human animals (which includes but is not limited to: wild animal suffering, farm animal suffering and pets)  
  I seem to care less about insects than other animals by a lot (I still care though), but I have to introspect more on this  
  I am more of an abolitionism than a welfarist in terms of suffering  
  therefore, I prefer interventions that focus on reducing the number of total future animals that suffer rather than make them suffer less  
  for instance, for non-human animals, I tend to prefer interventions that increase the number of vegans rather than icreasing cage size for animals
- **Reducing involuntary deaths**  
  Ideally I would want everyone to only die when they want to; including humans and non-human animals  
  that includes, non exhaustively, reducing accidental deaths and reducing death by diseases  including ageing  
  I want people to have the ability of living 1000 years or until the [heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe) if they want to  
- **Improving health**  
  good health is instrumental to many other goals/values
- **Empowering humans**  
  Empowering humans and decreasing poverty seems instrumental to many other goals/values
- **Improving planning for the long term**  
  It seems to me that people in general do not plan for the long term (from 100 years to [heat death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe))  
  and that if they did, it would greatly increase the efficiency of their impact on the world (see [https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/](https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/))  
  also, most people seem to be unaware of [existential risks](https://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html)  

### My causes

- **Improving global coordination** and **Improving institutional decision making**  
  See [https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/)  
  I am very uncertain if most humans share the same intrinsic values that I have, but feel like it might be true  
  for instance it looks like most people want to reduce suffering  
  also, it looks like, in total, governments and big organizations have a lot of money at their disposition that they can stir to different causes  
  they also have the power to influence laws, regulations and policies that might have a big impact on the future  
  finally, it looks like governments and big organizations do not spend the money on issues that looks more like a priority to me, and it looks like they often do not spend money on the most effective interventions when they do spend money to try to help a cause  
  combining the 3 previous statements, it makes me think that maybe those governments and organizations have issues prioritizing causes, taking effective decisions and coordinating at a global scale  
  the sheer size of money that those organizations could redirect, and because it looks at least a big neglected to me, make me think that this is the most important cause out of all my causes  
  unfortunately I do not know any non-profit organizations or charities working on this that accepts donation, if you think you might know one, [please comment on this question on the effective altruism forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Sy9wsGFkZZkYifwwq/effective-charities-for-improving-institutional-decision)
