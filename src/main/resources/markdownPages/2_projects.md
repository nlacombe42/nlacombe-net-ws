### Euterpe
Uri: [https://euterpe-api.nlacombe.net/pages/index.html](https://euterpe-api.nlacombe.net/pages/index.html)

An app to manage my music.
You can only login with spotify and filter your spotify playlists.

This is very useful for me because I have 100+ spotify playlists, and
the spotify ui is currently (2020-10) not so great to deal with lots of playlists.
It does not list playlists in the order created or in alphabetical order,
it often fails to show all of my playlists,
and it does not allow searching in my playlists only.
